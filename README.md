# Will Ryan's Portfolio

This project is my personal web dev portfolio, you can visit the live website at [willpaulryan.github.io](https://willpaulryan.github.io).

## Technologies

The portfolio is created with:

* React.js
* [react-particles-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-particles-js)

and is deployed to Github Pages with [react-gh-pages](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages).

## Sources

This project was inspired by Mantie Reid II's [personal portfolio](https://mantiereidii.com/wp/), which I believe is a custom Wordpress template. I first saw Mantie's portfolio in a [Youtube video](https://youtu.be/PDDqtJHxFfw?list=WL&t=458) by Josh Fluke.
